# Prime

A small and simple program written to keep up with what I still remember from
Number Theory (oh man, this brings back sad and depressing memories...).

This is intended for my own review and personal lookup for relearning or keeping
up with Haskell (and partially keeping up Number Theory and Mathematical Logic).
This is basically a small portion of my notes in Haskell and Functional
Programming.

For more info, go read up Number Theory (MATC15) notes and a little bit of the
Mathematical Logical (MATC09) notes or just striaght up read the relevant parts
from the 2001/2002 Mathematical Logic Textbook by Enderton when concepts of
Mathematical Logic come up (if you end up doing so, good luck... make sure to
keep the crying to a minimum).

*Version may vary as I will keep updating this (whenever I finally have the time....)
