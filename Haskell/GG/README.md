# Geography Game

A simple little game where two players are to provide a word where the 
current player must provide a word which the first letter of the word 
matches the last letter of the previously mentioned word.

Determines which of the available remaining valid words at any given
game state will lead to a winning move when called.

This has been altered a little as a limitation has been placed such that 
the list of words are given before hand which can be used in the game.
This is to ensure that the computablity of the program is computable as
the Geograph Game is not believed to be in P.
