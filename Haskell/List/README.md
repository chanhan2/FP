# List

A small and simple program (rewritten in my way) to support and perform the usual
List operations.

This is intended for my own review and personal lookup for relearning or keeping
up with Haskell (and partially keeping up with what I learned in Set Theory and
Mathematical Logic).
This is basically a small portion of my notes in Haskell and Functional
Programming.

For more info, read more about List and Sets.

*Version may vary as I will keep updating this (whenever I finally have the time....)
