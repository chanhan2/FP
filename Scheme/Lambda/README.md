# Lambda Abstraction and Diagonialization

The use of Lambda functions are usually well defined to handle procedural and
dynamic methods. Lambda provides an interestingly useful mean to hide any 
reversive behaviour by translating into either a function composition or direct
computation. This allows for defining behaviour of a function instead of a nested
logical flow construct.

Diagonialization is where the function input is itself and is closed by a well
defined behaviour, such that it is either sound or complete. This allows for
a dynamic computation where an input is always associated with a conclusive 
result.
